Learning the C programming language is a great way to get a strong foundation in programming concepts. Here's a step-by-step guide to get you started with C programming using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) on Windows 10:

# Step 1: Install VS Code
If you haven't already installed Visual Studio Code, you can download and install it from the official website.

# Step 2: Install the C/C++ Extension for VS Code
Open VS Code.
Go to the Extensions view by clicking on the square icon in the sidebar or pressing Ctrl+Shift+X.
Search for C/C++ and install the extension provided by Microsoft.

# Step 3: Install a C Compiler
To compile and run C programs, you'll need a C compiler. The most commonly used one is GCC (GNU Compiler Collection). You can install it via the MSYS2 software distribution.
